My name is Andrew. I'm graduating soon with a degree in computer science and studio art. I've always wanted to do a long-term project that I can be proud of, and thankfully this blog/project gives me a chance to do so.

When I'm not programming, you'll find me swimming laps, drawing pictures, or eating cheeseburgers.
