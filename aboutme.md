My name is Andrew. This is my blog. Some quick facts about me:

- I drive a google streetview car.
- I'm studying both computer science and studio art.
- I have the short term memory capacity of a 7-year-old.
- I live in beer city USA.
- I help to organize a relatively large hackathon in my hometown.

When I'm not programming, you'll find me swimming laps, drawing pictures, or eating cheeseburgers.
