Cities. They fascinate me. There are plenty of more subtle and invisible ways that humanity has progressed, but -- in my opinion -- megacities are the boldest and loudest testaments to civilization as we know it. Vast swathes of concrete and glass have replaced the natural landscape that dominated the area for millions of years. It is almost a biome of its own - posionous to some, but quite an opportunity for others.

You're probably thinking '*Now how is this author going to tie such an altruistic statement to his shitty algorithm?*' (And you have every right to think that - I ask myself the same thing every day)

### Procedural Generation and the Urban Landscape

The notion that cities develop organically and follow the patterns of nature is not a new one. Famously, academics Parish and Muller [wrote a paper](https://cgl.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/Papers/2001/p_Par01.pdf) that modeled road maps after *L-Systems*, a method commonly used to model trees and bushes. Muller went on to make a software entirely dedicated to the concept called CityEngine.

I've used Muller's techniques (along with many other similar sources) to build my own building generator, which can be found in this [lengthy report](https://github.com/andrewmanq/cs344/blob/master/project/submission/report.ipynb). Putting these buildings along a road system has produced some pretty amazing results.
