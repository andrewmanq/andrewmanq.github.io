That's right, it's time for the obligatory 'first post'. Believe me, the paragraphs below are probably not worth reading, as most of it will be either painfully obvious from my other posts or misinformative due to the ever-changing nature of my impulses.

## Why a blog?

I've always found that portfolios are a useful way to showcase my artwork. A well-curated and easily accessible website that encompasses my abilities works perfectly for visual arts. This blog is a portfolio of sorts, a showcase of my technical programming abilities. It will also be a way for me to express myself, like most personal blogs. I plan to write at least a few opinion peices, although the main body of posts will be tangible project information.

## So are you trying to be the next famous blogger guy or something?

I don't actually follow many bloggers, so if this universe truly is a just one, my RSS feed will be a like tree falling in the forest (with no one around to hear it). That's okay, because I mostly want to use blog posts to motivate myself to keep working on stuff. Whether or not it's popular is besides the point. That said, I would gladly take the position of famous blogger guy if I was offered it.
